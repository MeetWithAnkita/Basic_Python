11. To draw a Pascal triangle based on given number of rows
Hints for drawing the Pascal’s Triangle
The first 6 rows of Pascal’s Triangle are shown in Figure-1:
Let us learn how to Build the Pascal’s Triangle manually.
• At the top center of a piece of paper let us write the number
“1.”
• On the next row we write two 1’s so that they form a triangle.
• On each of the subsequent rows we start and end with 1’s and
compute each interior term by adding the two numbers above
it.
This is illustrated below
                1
            1       1
        1       2       1

12. A program is required which accepts two numbers then prints out
a random number somewhere between those two numbers without
using the built in random function.

13. A program is required which will accept a date in either long hand
or short hand (e.g. either 19/7/2019 or 19th July, 2019 ) with a view
to determine if the given date is valid. e.g. 14/13/2019 is clearly
not valid.

14. To determine various types of numbers as defined below within a
given range:
(a) A Harshad number is a number that is divisible by the sum of
its own digits. For example, 1729 is a Harshad number because
1 + 7 + 2 + 9 = 19 and 1729 = 1991. Harshad numbers are
also known as Niven numbers.
(b) An Abundant number is a number that is smaller than the
sum of its aliquot parts (Proper divisors). For example, twelve
is the smallest abundant number, because, the sum of its aliquot
parts is 1+2+3+4+6=16—-followed by 18, 20, 24 and 30.
(c) A weird number is an abundant number that is not semiperfect; in other words, n is weird if the sum of its divisors is greater
than n, but n is not equal to the sum of any subset of its divisors. The first few weird numbers are 70, 836, 4030, 5830, and
7192.
(d) Amicable numbers are pairs of numbers, also known as friendly
numbers, each of whose aliquot parts add to give the other number. (An aliquot part is any divisor that doesn’t include the
number itself).
(e) An Automorphic number, also known as an automorph,
is a number n whose square ends in n. For instance 5 is automorphic, because 5
2 = 25, which ends in 5. A number n is
called trimorphic if n
3
ends in n. For example 493
, = 117649,
is trimorphic. Not all trimorphic numbers are automorphic. A
number n is called tri-automorphic if 3n
2
ends in n; for example
667 is tri-automorphic because 3 × 6672
, = 1334667, ends in
667.
(f) A Fermat number is a number defined by the formula Fn =
2
2
n
+ 1 numbers, F0 = 3, F1 = 5, F2 = 17, F3 = 257, and F4
= 65,537. It is required to test whether all the Fermat
numbers are prime or not.
(g) A Happy number is one which ultimately generates 1 through
the iterative process of summing of the squares of the digits.For
example,7 → (72
) → 49 → (42 + 92
) → 97 → (92 + 72
) →
130 → (12 + 32
) → 10 → 1. So, 7 is a Happy number.But,
20 is not a happy number, since,
2
2 + 02 =4
4
2 = 16
1
2 + 62 =37
3
2 + 72 =58
5
2 + 82 =89
8
2 + 92 =145
1
2 + 42 + 52 =40
4
2 + 02 =4(Reappears a number obtained earlier)
(h) A special two-digit number is such that when the sum of its
digits is added to the product of its digits, the result equals the
original two-digit number. For example, for the number 59,Sum
of the digits=5+9=14 and product of its digits=5*9=45 and
hence total=14+45=59.
(i) WAP to accept a number and then to check whether it is a perfect square or not. If it is a perfect square then show a message
for that; if not, then find out the least number to be added to
the number to make the given number a perfect square. For example, if the given number is 1950, then the least number to be
added to the number to make it a perfect square is determined
as follows: 452 - 1950=75.
(j) A number is said to be a Niven number if it is divisible by
the sum of its digits. For example,126 is a Niven number.
(k) A number is said to be a Neon number if the sum of the digits
of the square of the number equals the number. For example, 9
is a Neon number.
(l) A number is said to be an Automorphic number if the number is contained in the ending digits of its square. For example,
25 is such a number because 252 =625 where 25 the original
number is contained.
(m) Two numbers are said to be co-prime if their HCF is one.
(n) WAP to display the product of the successors of even digits of
a given number.
(o) A number is said to be a Pronic number if it a product of two
consecutive integers. Example: 12, 20, 42 etc. such numbers
are also known as Oblong numbers.
(p) A prime number is said to a Twisted Prime, if the new
number formed by reversing its digits is also a prime number.
For example, 167 is a twisted prime because 761 is also prime.
(q) A number is said to a Duck number if it contains a zero.
(r) A number is said to be an Abundant number if the sum of its
proper divisors is greater than the number itself. For example,
12 is an abundant number.
(s) A number is said to a Spy number if the sum of its digits
equals the product of its digits. For example, 1124 is a Spy
number.
(t) A number is said to be a Harshad number, if it is divisible by
the sum of its digits. For example, 132 is a Harshad number.
(u) A number is said to be a Sunny number if the square root of its
successor is a whole number.
(v) Tribonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers similar to
Fibonacci numbers except that such a number is formed by
adding the three preceding numbers. For example, 1, 1, 2, 4,
7,13, . . . . . . . . . ..are Tribonacci numbers.
(w) The sum of given n terms for some given value of x(where there
is x) is required for the following series:
i. 1+ (1+2) +(1+2+3) + · · · +(1+2+3+· · ·n)
ii. 1+(1*2) +(1*2*3)+· · ·+(1*2*3*· · · *n)
iii. 1 + 1+2
1∗2 +
1+2+3
1∗2∗3 + · · · +
1+2+3+···+n
1∗2∗3∗···∗n
. . . up to n terms
(x) A number is said to be a Multiple Harshed Number if a
Harshed Number, when divided by the sum of its digits,
produces another Harshed Number. For example, 6804 is
a Multiple Harshed Number.
(y) A number is said to be a Magic Number if the eventual sum
of the digits of the number becomes 1. For example, 55 and 289
are magic numbers because, for 55,5+5=10, 1+0=1, similarly
for 289,2+8+9=19,1+9=10,1+0=1
15. To determine various types of numbers as defined below within a
given range:
(a) A right-angled triangle of consecutive natural numbers from 1
to n is called a Floyd’s triangle.
(b) A hyperfactorial number is a number such as 108, which is
equal to 3
3 ×2
2 ×1
1
. In general, the n
th hyperfactorial H(n)
is given by: H(n) = n
n
(n − 1)(n−1)
· · · 3

(c) A Kaprekar number of d digits is defined as a number the
square of which if separated into two parts of d and d / (d1) digits depending on the availability of digits, can regenerate
the number by the sum of the two parts. For example: 9 is
a Kaprekar number; because, 9
2=81 and as 9 is a one-digit
number, we separate the digits in the square in two parts each
containing one digit i.e. 8 and 1. Again, 8+1=9, regenerates
the number.
(d) A vampire number is a natural number x that can be factorized as y × z in such a way that the number of occurrences of
a particular digit in the representation of x in a given base (say
10) appears the same number of times in the representations
in that same base of y and z together. For example, 2187 is a
vampire number since 2187 = 21 × 87 ; similarly 136948 is a
vampire because 136948 = 146 × 938. Vampire numbers are a
whimsical idea that was introduced by Clifford Pickover in
1995.
(e) A sublime number is a number such that both the sum of
its divisors and the number of its divisors are perfect numbers.
The smallest sublime number is 12. There are 6 divisors of 12
– 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 – the sum of which is 28. Both 6 and 28
are perfect. The second sublime number begins 60865..., ends
...91264, and has a total of 76 digits! It is not known if there are
larger even sublime numbers, nor if there are any odd sublime
numbers.
(f) A Smith number is a composite number, the sum of whose
digits equals the sum of the digits of its prime factors. The
name stems from a phone call in 1984 by the mathematician Albert Wilansky to his brother-in-law, called Smith, during which
Wilansky noticed that the phone number, 4937775, obeyed the
condition just mentioned. Specifically: 4937775 = 3 × 5 × 5 ×
65837
(g) A lucky number is a number in a sequence, first identified and
named around 1955 by Stanislaw Ulam, that evades a particular
type of number "sieve" (similar to the famous Sieve of Eratosthenes), which works as follows. Start with a list of integers,
including 1, and cross out every second number: 2, 4, 6, 8, ...
The second surviving integer is 3. Cross out every third number
not yet eliminated. This removes 5, 11, 17, 23, ... The third surviving number from the left is 7; cross out every seventh integer
not yet eliminated: 19, 39, ... Repeat this process indefinitely
and the numbers that survive are the "lucky" ones:
(h) A Pandigital number is an integer that contains each of the digits from 0 to 9 and whose leading digit is nonzero. The first
few pandigital numbers are 1023456789, 1023456798, 1023456879,
1023456897, and 1023456978. A ten-digit pandigital number is
always divisible by 9. If zeros are excluded, the first few "zeroless" pandigital numbers are 123456789, 123456798, 123456879,
123456897, 123456978, and 123456987, and the first few zeroless pandigital primes are 1123465789, 1123465879, 1123468597,
1123469587, and 1123478659. The sum of the first 32423 (a
palindromic number) consecutive primes is 5897230146, which
is pandigital. No other palindromic number shares this property. Examples of palindromic numbers that are the product of
pandigital numbers are 2 970 408 257 528 040 792 (= 1 023 687
954 × 2 901 673 548) and 5 550 518 471 748 150 555 (= 1 023 746
895 × 5 421 768 309), both found in 2001. A pandigital product
is a product in which the digits of the multiplicand, multiplier,
and product, taken together, form a pandigital number
