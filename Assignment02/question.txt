basic pay and the designation as per the following rules:
Basic Pay               Designation      Percentage of basic pay payable
<40,000                 Manager          12% of the basic pay subject to minimum of Rs. 2500

12. For the first 75 calls, the charge is fixed and it is equal to Rs. 75;
for the next 75 calls, the charge is calculated @Rs 0.75 per call; for
the next 90 calls, the charge is Rs.0.65 per call and for the rest,
if any, the rate is Rs.0.55 per call. It is required to determine the

13. In a certain country, the difference between two consecutive gas
meter readings gives the amount of gas consumed in cubic feet. It
is then multiplied by a factor 1.475 to convert it into the number
of therms used by the consumer, where therm is the unit of billing.
The meter readings are collected at the end of each month. The
following rate chart is then used by the gas company to calculate
the bill amount of each consumer:
No. of therms used                       Rate per therm
     <=125                                   Rs.7.75
  >125 but <=250                   Rs. 9.75 plus a surcharge of 1.25% over the calculated charge;
      >250                         Rs. 13.00 plus a surcharge 0f 2.5% over the calculated charge.
A meter rent of Rs.25 is also added to the gas charges of each
consumer to determine the gas bill. If the gas meters display 8-digit
readings, then develop a script in Python is required to determine
the monthly gas bill of the consumers.

14. In a certain area, the parking charge for cars is calculated according

beyond the 23 hours limit, the charge Rs. 5.50 for every minute.
Develop a Python script to calculate the parking charge for the
users of the area.
